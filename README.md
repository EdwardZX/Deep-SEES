# Deep-SEES
This project is based on PyTorch, and colab
Matlab Data Preprocessing (processing) (only need to be processed once):
Use the transform_data (name, xy, polar(optional)) function to save the xy and polar:
- Make sure the length of the xy and polar files are equal
- addpath('./MyUtils/MyTrajectoryPara/'); addpath('./MyUtils/');
